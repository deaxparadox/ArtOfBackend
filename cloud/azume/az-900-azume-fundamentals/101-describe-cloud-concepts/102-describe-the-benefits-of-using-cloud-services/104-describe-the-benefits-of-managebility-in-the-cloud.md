# Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

A major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability options. There are two types of manageability for cloud computing:

1. Management of the cloud
2. Management in the cloud


### Management of the cloud

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

### Management in the cloud

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

- Through a web portal.
- Using a command line interface.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.
